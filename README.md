# data.services
This project is a backend service developed on .NET Core using a layered architecture. It leverages ServiceStack for RESTful APIs and DevExpress for the management panel and reporting features. PostgreSQL is used as the primary high-performance database. Recently, Redis has been integrated to enhance caching, data retrieval speed, and support geo-based queries, improving overall system scalability and responsiveness. The project focuses on building a scalable, maintainable, and high-performance system based on modern design principles.
